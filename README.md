## Project Objective:
- The main objective is to analyze customer behavior and provide insights to stakeholders in order to grow the business of products available in the Music Store. The dataset provided included data on artists, albums, and sales. By examining this data, my aim is to identify the highest-selling artist albums and gain a better understanding of customer behavior patterns.

### Task:
- Use SQL queries to answer various questions.

**Questions:**
- Who is the oldest employee?
- Which artists have sold the maximum number of albums?
- Which country has the maximum number of invoices?
- Total count of top 10 Rock bands, which all are the songs having an average length longer than average song length.

### Approach:
- In this SQL project, I began by examining the dataset to determine the number of columns available. Next, I focused on understanding the data schema, specifically identifying the tables and their relationships, including the complexities within each table.

### Data Quality Checks:
- Focused on checking for missing values, and null columns ensuring proper text, and validating headers in the dataset.

### Learnings:
- Better and indepth understanding of joins
- Used different advanced analytical and aggregate functionse in this project.
- Brushed the basics like SELECT, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.

### Key Findings:
- USA and Canada have a maximum number of invoices has been generated.
